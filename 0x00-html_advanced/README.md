Welcome!
Welcome to the Web Stack specialization. The 3 first projects will give you all basics of the Web development: HTML, CSS and Developer tools.

In this project, you will learn how to use HTML tags to structure a web page. No CSS, no styling - don’t worry, the final page will be “ugly” it’s normal, it’s not the purpose of this project.

Important note: details are important! lowercase vs uppercase / wrong letter… be careful!

Requirements
A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator
Techium will be the name of the company we will use across our webpages.

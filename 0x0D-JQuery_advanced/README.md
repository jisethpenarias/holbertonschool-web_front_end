**Tasks**

**0. Setup your dev environment:**
In a file 0-index.html:

Load the latest version of jQuery using their code.jquery.com CDN
Use the Slim & minified version of jQuery
When the page is being loaded, verify that jQuery is loaded correctly
If jQuery is ready to be used, log to the console jQuery has been loaded correctly
If jQuery has not been loaded properly, log to the console jQuery has not been loaded correctly
Requirements

Make sure your code is in a script of type application/javascript.


**1. Creating a DOM element:**
In a file 1-index.html, reuse the template you created previously.

Remove the code that verifies jQuery loaded and logs messages to the console
Create a function named createTextElement:
Within the function, create a p HTML element
The paragraph should display Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed in diam risus. Nunc sit amet euismod ipsum. Aenean tempus ex sed est volutpat, sed sodales velit tempus. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos. Proin auctor sollicitudin eleifend. Vivamus porta enim vitae mauris commodo, vitae tempor tellus elementum. Quisque sed pellentesque nulla, at eleifend nisi. Phasellus eget tincidunt ex. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Add the paragraph to the body of the page
Call the createTextElement function
Requirements:

You must use jQuery only to generate the HTML tag and attach it to the page
Use the keyword append to attach the element to the page.

**2. Creating multiple DOM elements at once:**
In a file 2-index.html, reuse the template you created previously.

Remove the function createTextElement
Create a function named createFamilyTree:
It should create a table element
The head of the table should display Firstname and Lastname in two cells
The body of the table should three rows
The first row should contain two cells with Guillaume and Salva
The second row should contain two cells with Paulette and Salva
The third row should contain two cells with Antoine and Salva
Use the keyword append only once to attach all the elements of the table to the page
Call the createFamilyTree function
Requirements:

You must use jQuery only to generate the HTML tag and attach it to the page
The entire table code should be contained in one string.

**3. Chain DOM elements:**
In a file 3-index.html, reuse the template you created previously. Reuse also the function named createFamilyTree:

The table is containing the exact same values as the previous task
This time, create each element one by one
Use the keywords append for each element and text for the cells
Do not create any intermediate variable
Call the createFamilyTree function
Tips:

You can append multiple elements at once, by separating the elements with a comma
Requirements:

You must use jQuery only to generate the HTML tag and attach it to the page.

**4. HTML function:**
In a file 4-index.html, reuse the template you created in the previous task. Reuse also the function named createFamilyTree.

Create a new function replaceFamilyTree:
It should replace the childrens of the tbody elements with a new tr
The tr element should contain two cells with Gerard and Bonissa in each
Make sure createFamilyTree and replaceFamilyTree are called
Requirements:

You must use the keyword html to replace the content of the table.

**5. Click attribute and remove function:**
In a file 5-index.html, reuse the template you created previously.

Remove the createFamilyTree and replaceFamilyTree functions
Create a function createFamilyTree:
It should append to the body an empty table, with thead and two cells with text Firstname and Lastname, respectively
It should append an empty tbody element to the table after the thead
Create a function addNewMember:
It accepts two arguments firstName(string) and lastName(string)
It appends to the body of the table a new row with three cells
The first cell displays the firstName, the second cell displays the lastName
The third cell displays (x)
On click on the third cell, it should remove the row
Add CSS to the third cell to have an orange background
Calls the function createFamilyTree
Using addNewMember, generate a fake table with:
the first row Guillaume, Salva
the second row Arielle, Snizt
the third row Fanette, Snizt
the fourth row Gerard, Snizt
the fifth row Victor, Salva
Requirements:

You must use the keywords click, css, and remove

**6. Val, before, and prepend functions:**
Reuse the function createFamilyTree you wrote in the previous task
Reuse the function addNewMember you wrote in the previous task, and add the following modification:
The function should accept a new argument position(string)
When position is equal to before, it should add the row at the top of the table
Otherwise, it should add the row at the bottom of the table
Write a function createForm:
It should add before the table two input of type text
It should add a select with two options as well: before and after with corresponding Before and After text
It should add a input of type submit as well
When the user clicks on the submit, it should call the function addNewMember with the value of the two inputs and the value of the select element
Call the function createFamilyTree
Call the function createForm

**7. Query - Setup your dev environment:**
Remove the functions from the script
Import jQuery using the CDN and make sure you can access the ajax methods

Create a form:

Create a function createSearchForm, it should append to the body:
An empty input of type text without ID, name, or class
An input of type submit
When the user clicks on the submit button, it should query the function queryWikipedia that you are going to create with the value of the text input
An empty ul element
Create a function addNewArticle to add new items to a list

It accepts three arguments id(string), title(string), and snippet(string)
It create an element li
Within the li, add two paragraph elements
The first paragraph contains a span tag with the following text: id -, then a b element with the title
The second paragraph, should contain the snippet
Appends the li to the ul element (created by createSearchForm)
Implement a get function: create a function queryWikipedia

It accepts one argument search(string)
Create a data object with attributes required to query a search using the string passed in the argument with Wikipedia
For each result returned by the API, call the function addNewArticle with the result???s pageid, title, and snippet
Call the function createSearchForm when the page loads

**8. Pagination:**
Modify the function createSearchForm:

It should append to the body another list, with the id pagination
Modify the function queryWikipedia:

Add a new parameter named offset(number)
By default, the offset should be set to 0
Modify the data object to add the offset
When you receive the response from the API, call the function buildPagination that you are going to create below
Create a new function named buildPagination:

It accepts three arguments numberOfItems(number), itemsPerPage(number), and currentOffset(number)
When the function is called, reset the pagination list to an empty tag
Write a loop that will display the pagination (using the total number of items divided by the number of items per page)
For each page, create a list item
Add some CSS for each item (cursor: 'pointer', 10px margin left, and bold when this is the current page)
The text of the item should be the page number
When clicking on a page number, it should call the function queryWikipedia with the right offset

**9. Wrap/unwrap:**
In the header, add some CSS, with the style tag:

Add a new class named loading
Set the opacity at 0.2 within that class
In your script with your other functions, create a function named displayLoading:

It accepts one argument loading
It select the first ul element of the page
If loading is true, it wraps the element with a div tag and the class loading
If loading is false, it unwrap the ul from the div
Modify the queryWikipedia function:

It should call the function displayLoading before querying the API
Once the API returns the value, it should remove the opacity by calling the function again
